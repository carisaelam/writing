# Controllers 

## Introduction 
**Controllers** are like the middlemen. They take in the request and then go ask the Model to handle things. It collects the correct bunch of instance variables and hands them off. In general, controllers should be lightweight with a small amount of code but a largest amount of impact. 

**Spelling** has to be exactly right. Whatever you name your controller and action in the `routes.rb` file HAS to be what they are named in the file structure. 


**RESTful actions automatically generated by the resources route** 

1. **`Index`** - retrieves all records from the database
2. **`Show`** - retrieves a particular record from the database
3. **`New`** - creates a new instance of your record
4. **`Create`** - saves the new instance to the database
5. **`Edit`** - renders the record to be updated
6. **`Update`** - updates the record and saves to database
7. **`Destroy`** - deletes the record
