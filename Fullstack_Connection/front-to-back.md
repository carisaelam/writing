# Connecting Vue.js front-end to Node.js backend

## REST Basics

Client - app itself (frontend)
Server - backend services

Client can call on the server using HTTP requests

REST - Representations State Transfers

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete data (CRUD)

Example - Vidly company for renting out movies

endpoint = http://vidly.com/api/customers
'/api' == not required, but commonly used way to signify that you are working with the api
'/customers' == resource

type of request determines the type of operation

every HTTP request has a verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

**MOST COMMON HTTP VERBS**
GET /api/customers [get all customers]
GET /api/customers/1 [get specific customer]
POST /api/customers, {name: ''} [create new customer with provided req.body]
PUT /api/customer/1, {name: ''} [updates specific customer with provided req.body]
DELETE /api/customer/1 [deletes specific customer]

## Tools

### Express.js
Lightweight framework built on top of the http module in node.js 

Manually defining routes in plain node.js is tedious and prone to bugs due to length of code 

### Axios
